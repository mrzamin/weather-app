## About This Project
Building this app helped me understand how to work with APIs and asynchronous JavaScript code.

### Requirements
- Fetch and process JSON weather data from the Weather API
- Display weather 
- Toggle Fahrenheit and Celsius 
- Allow user input
- Change app display based on the weather condition (sunny, overcast, etc.)
- Use JavaScript Promises or Async/Await syntax in code

## Lessons Learned

This project was a joy to work on. Going into it, I had an idea for the layout and knew I wanted to play with animated backgrounds. Looking at the Weather API's offerings, I was overwhelmed with all the possible choices for data. I started a list of all the information I wanted my app to have, but at a certain point, brainstorming a wish list prevented me from just getting started. I decided to start with basic weather data, then later I would add more weather indicators after my project had taken initial shape. There were a lot of errors to troubleshoot when writing my asynchronous functions that helped me to grow and solidify my understanding of async code more than just reading or doing practice exercises had done. When I got an error, I was like, _oh, right_, a promise is being returned! It felt like a milestone in my learning to work with APIs. I will definitely be exploring more of [them](https://github.com/n0shake/Public-APIs) for future project ideas.

## What I'd Like to Work On in the Future
- Additional background themes such as a "snow blizzard" theme
- More specific form validation, such as input length and ZIP code pattern constraints
  - Latter requires research on global ZIP patterns
- An image/card slider for the forecast section
- An option to mark/save a location to "Favorites"
- Local or session storage to save the user's "Favorites"
