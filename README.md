## About This Project
Building this app helped me understand working with APIs and asynchronous JavaScript code.

### Requirements
- Fetch and process JSON weather data from the Weather API
- Display weather 
- Toggle Fahrenheit and Celsius 
- Allow user input
- Change app display based on the weather condition (sunny, overcast, etc.)
- Use JavaScript Promises or Async/Await syntax in code

## Lessons Learned

## What I'd Like to Work On / Improve Upon in the Future
- Additional background themes such as a "snow blizzard" theme
- More specific form validation, such as a input length and ZIP code pattern constraints (requires research on global ZIP patterns)
- An image/card slider for the forecast section
- An option to mark/save a location to "Favorites"
- Local or session storage to save the user's "Favorites" 

## Credits
- Weather data from [weatherapi.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/)
- Color palette from [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Night Palette](https://nightpalette.com/)
